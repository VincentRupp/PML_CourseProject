Course Project for Practical Machine Learning

This repo is the R Markdown, .md, and .html files for the course project in Practical Machine Learning, offered by Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health via the Coursera learning platform.

*Note to Graders*
I'm not sure what a gh-pages branch is exactly. It looks simple enough, but I've been working on this course all day and want to just check the box in my assignment tracking spreadsheet.

Anyway, I'll figure out the gh-pages branch later. For now, you can view the project.md file to see the markdown or visit [the final knitted .html document on my webpage](http://vincentrupp.com/PML_project.html "PML Project HTML")
