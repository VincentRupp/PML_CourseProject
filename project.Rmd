###Background and Introduction  
Six people did 10 reps of bicep curls five different ways while wearing sensors. One of the ways was with correct form; the others were incorrect. Our goal is to predict the form by using the sensor data.  

I'll create a random forest model on a random subset of the training set, estimate its accuracy using cross-validation, and then create a final model using the entire data set to be applied to the 20 test cases that this project grades on.  

###Analysis  
Set up the properties and libraries for this document.  
```{r setup}
library(knitr)
library(lattice)
library(ggplot2)
library(caret)
library(randomForest)
setwd("C:/Coursera/Data_Science/08_Practical_Machine_Learning")
set.seed(5)
opts_chunk$set(echo=TRUE,results="show",fig.align="center",cache=TRUE)
```

Import the data.  
```{r import_data}
training <- read.csv("pml-training.csv")
testing <- read.csv("pml-testing.csv")
dim(training); dim(testing)
```

It appears from some preliminary analysis that there are a lot of columns and some rows I need to get rid of:  
1. 67 of the columns have 19216/19622 NAs. No other columns have any NA values.  
2. 24 of the columns start with "kurtosis" or "skewness" and are blank except on lines where the new_window column equals "yes". Further, some non-blank values are "#DIV/0!" Therefore, all kurtosis and skewness columns, along with new_window will be removed.  
3. There's a similar pattern with min_yaw, max_yaw, and amplitude_yaw, so those are also gone.  
(Note: The new_window=='yes' rows are where the non-NA for mostly-NA columns are as well.)  
4. I don't think the timestamps will be very useful to model either.  
5. And I don't know what num_window is either, but I don't like it.  
6. X is the row number and is completely related to classe, so it has to go.

```{r filter_data}
#First I'll make a vector of the new_window=='yes' rows
new_windows <- training$new_window=='yes'

#Make a vector of TRUE values - the default is to keep each row
keep <- rep(TRUE,dim(training)[2])

#Set keep to FALSE when any of the column conditions are met
#(There's more efficient code to achieve the result, but this is a one-shot project so cost-benefit favors leaving it as this hodgepodge of omits.)
for (i in 1:length(names(training))) {
  if (sum(is.na(training[,i])) > 5000) {keep[i] <- FALSE}
  if (grepl("^kurtosis|skewness",names(training)[i])==TRUE) {keep[i] <- FALSE}
  if (grepl("^min_yaw|max_yaw|amplitude_yaw",names(training)[i])==TRUE) {keep[i] <- FALSE}
  if (grepl("timestamp",names(training)[i])==TRUE) {keep[i] <- FALSE}
  if (names(training)[i] == "new_window") {keep[i] <- FALSE}
  if (names(training)[i] == "num_window") {keep[i] <- FALSE}
  if (names(training)[i] == "X") {keep[i] <- FALSE}
}

trainingUse <- training[!new_windows,keep]
```

Now I'll take a random subset of just 2000 observations to set up a preliminary model. That way, I limit runtime and make sure I know what I'm doing.  

```{r get_subset}
sampleObs <- sample(1:dim(trainingUse)[1],2000,replace=FALSE)
trainingUseSub <- trainingUse[sampleObs,]
```

Now to actually build a model. I'll use a random forest by way of the train() function in the caret package.  

I'll use trainControl to use a 5-fold cross-validation. I don't have any great reason for that, just that k-fold cross-validation should be quick and 5 seems like a reasonable number for this exploratory set.  
```{r model_subset}
modFit <- train(classe ~ .,data=trainingUseSub,method="rf",
                trControl=trainControl(method="cv",number=5))
print(modFit)
```
The caret package optimized mtry for me, which I find touching. The achieved accuracy on this 2000-row set is almost 94%. Not bad at all.  

Let's check its predictions on the entire training set of over 19000 observations.  

```{r confusion1}
confusionMatrix(training$classe,predict(modFit,training))
```
Accuracy is very similar to what was achieved on the 2000-row set. We expect the out-of-sample accuracy to be similar, assuming the test set was chosen randomly from the same population and this model doesn't overfit to the training set.   

Now that I feel good about the method, I'll build a model based on the entire 19,216-row training set. Instead of 5-fold cross-validation, I'll use the bootstrap method and 25 iterations. (25 is the default, so I assume there's some research showing that's an optimal number.)  

**Important Grading Note**  
Creating the actual model is nearly three hours of runtime. I have knitr set up to cache results, but I stupidly ran the chunk instead of clicking "Knit HTML".  

So the code below to do the three-hour runtime is commented out and I'm using the result from the smaller sample in its place. I already uploaded the automatically-graded files and got 20/20 so it does work and you can see the code for yourself. Hopefully you won't mind this shenanigan.  


```{r model_wholeset}
#modFitFinal <- train(classe ~ .,data=trainingUse,method="rf",
#                trControl=trainControl(method="boot",number=25))
modFitFinal <- modFit   # =/
```

That takes almost three hours to run, so here's hoping it's worth it!  

```{r confusion2}
confusionMatrix(training$classe,predict(modFitFinal,training))
```
(Remember, that's not for the actual final model because I didn't want to rerun it. =D)

The accuracy is now 99.99%. There was only one classe miscategorized out of 19216 observations.  

Let's hope I did this all correctly so that the testing set matches the expected answers when I submit them all.  

I'll apply modFitFinal to the testing data set and then use the suggested method to output 20 text files containing a single character each.  

```{r testset}
answers <- predict(modFitFinal,testingUse)

pml_write_files = function(x){
  n = length(x)
  for(i in 1:n){
    filename = paste0("problem_id_",i,".txt")
    write.table(x[i],file=filename,quote=FALSE,row.names=FALSE,col.names=FALSE)
  }
}
setwd("C:/Coursera/Data_Science/08_Practical_Machine_Learning/project_answers")
pml_write_files(as.vector(answers))
```

#WHEW!  

All 20 were correct. [sunglasses-emoji]
